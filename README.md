# An Almost Static Stack

This repo serves as a companion to the [tutorial of the same name, over on Medium](https://medium.com/superhighfives/).

## Getting started

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/superhighfives/an-almost-static-stack.git
cd an-almost-static-stack
yarn install
yarn start
```

Once you're ready to deploy to [Surge](https://surge.sh), run:

``` shell
yarn deploy
```

Voila!

If you're not into [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), `npm install`, `npm start` and `npm run deploy` all work as well.
