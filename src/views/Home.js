    <h2>THE INCUBATOR</h2>
    <span className='post-data'>el prego - 29 June 2017</span>
    <p>
      Ah the constant struggle to maintain an identity as soon as the “bun in
      the oven” news drops.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every day since I told people the news at work they ask how I’m feeling, and
      pay particular attention when I respond. Some of them even gaze openly at
      what I’ve fondly dubbed my “gunt” (for those unfamiliar with the term I’d
        reconsider whether you’ve come to the right place), and I always wonder
      what they are trying to see. My colleague with the undiagnosed eating
      disorder is probably seeking some satisfaction around how fat I’ll hopefully
      get. Do you know how weird it feels to get asked how you are, after having no
      fucker in seven years ask you that question? Now my workplace is particularly
      selfish, but seriously take pause and think, pregnant or not, when the hell
      was the last time someone asked not how you were, but HOW YOU WERE FEELING?
      And meant it, like stood there gaping at you awaiting the answer with baited
      breath?
    </p>
    <p>
      The second question that comes to my mind is, are they even asking for me? Or
      they seriously asking after that squid in my uterus which all due respect
      just developed the beginnings of a face a few weeks ago? Why are they so
      invested? These are people I’ve barely shared any personal information with
      suddenly needing a blow by blow update, and I’m curious about whether they
      want to know that I have a weird groin cramp at the moment, and that’s about
      it right now thankfully. I’m actually gearing up for a very heated meeting
      and ideally I’d like to vent about that while cramming about 15 slices of
      peanut butter toast in my face but nobody seems down for that catch up sesh.

      My sister texted me proactively for the first time in as long as I can
      remember.” How are you going? Over the morning sickness yet? “ I am
      reasonably close to her, and would generally call a few times a month. She
      was hopeless with returning the favour, but always chatted away whenever I
      rang. Now she has a child it’s nigh impossible to get her on the phone
      straight away, which one could understand. But suddenly, her name flashes up
      on my phone, totally unprompted. I dutifully respond and ask her the same as
      she is quite heavily pregnant at the moment. Once she is satisfied with my
      response I hear nothing more. I can’t help but think, she doesn’t want to
      know how my law that I have two law assignments due, that work is high stress
      because I’m running a three person team on my own, that I have a solo singing
      performance coming up, that I have a very important job interview next week…

      But she’s not the only one. In the first trimester it’s a constant fucking
      struggle not to lose your identity. You can be swimming through a haze of
      fatigue and nausea, a shell of a human ensnared inside a permanent hangover
      for days on end. You fight back against these polite inquiries from those
      you’ve been close enough to tell the news, but part of you doesn’t really
      care anymore because you do start wondering if you really will feel yourself
      again. Maybe you will have to submit to this squid overlord, quietly taking
      up more real estate in your womb and leaching the very calcium from your
      bones. But after the hangover clears (hello second trimester and my
        appetite), you’re observant as hell, and your gunt is pointing obnoxiously
      at these peasants who have newly received the information. You can smell
      every odour in the building including their obsequious agenda. You’re
      wondering how the fuck you’re going to deal with this struggle not to become
      nothing but a gunt. Only to lead to, nothing but a mother...
    </p>
    <p>
      The only advantage I think of to this new status is that people want to feed
      me. I will capitalise on this. Let them eat cake.
